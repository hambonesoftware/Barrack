Phase 1 â€“ Setup Environment
---------------------------
- Install Swift Playgrounds and ensure JavaScript interop is enabled (via web view or JS injection)
- Embed p5.js library and verify it runs in a canvas or web view area
- Display a basic animated shape (e.g., bouncing circle) to confirm p5.js is rendering correctly
- Set up file/project structure for game assets and code reuse
