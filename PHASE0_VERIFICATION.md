# Phase 0 Verification Matrix

| Acceptance Item | File / Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository map mirrors agreed phase plan | `docs/Architecture.md` – Phase 0 Goals & Module Boundaries; `docs/Styleguide.md` – Repository Conventions | OK | Documents confirm module boundaries, build flags, directory expectations, and alignment with Agents roadmap. |
| Example level data reviewed with confirmed `targetPercent` semantics | `docs/Architecture.md` – Example Level Data | OK | Provides annotated JSON snippet clarifying `targetPercent` win condition and deterministic seed usage. |
| Deterministic RNG spike demonstrates repeatable simulation API | `docs/Architecture.md` – Deterministic RNG Expectations; `tools/rng_spike.swift` | OK | Runnable SplitMix64 spike prints identical outputs for repeated seeds and documents execution instructions. |

## Additional Notes
- Retro UI palette, bevel, and accessibility specifications captured in `docs/Retro-UI-Spec.md` per UI designer responsibilities.
- Example data spikes live in `docs/data/levels.phase0.json` and `docs/data/palettes.phase0.json`, locking win percentage semantics and palette metadata.
- Risks & mitigations recorded in `docs/Architecture.md` align with Phase 0 risk register.
