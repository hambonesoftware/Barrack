# Phase 0 Verification Matrix

| Acceptance Item | File / Section | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository map mirrors agreed phase plan | `docs/Architecture.md` – Phase 0 Goals & System Context; `docs/Styleguide.md` – Repository Conventions | OK | Documents confirm module boundaries, directory expectations, and alignment with Agents roadmap. |
| Example level data reviewed with confirmed `targetPercent` semantics | `docs/Architecture.md` – Example Level Data | OK | Provides annotated JSON snippet clarifying `targetPercent` win condition and deterministic seed usage. |
| Deterministic RNG spike demonstrates repeatable simulation API | `docs/Architecture.md` – Backend & Engine Responsibilities | BLOCKED (Phase 1) | Phase 0 documents the API surface; actual spike implementation deferred to Phase 1 scaffolding. |

## Additional Notes
- Retro UI palette, bevel, and accessibility specifications captured in `docs/Retro-UI-Spec.md` per UI designer responsibilities.
- Risks & mitigations recorded in `docs/Architecture.md` align with Phase 0 risk register.
