# Barrack+ Agent Handbook

This directory captures the multi-phase swarm workflow for the Barrack+ Swift Playgrounds project. Every phase document follows a shared structure:

- **Objectives** – the tangible goals for the sprint.
- **Risks & Mitigation** – known blockers and fallback strategies.
- **Tasks by Agent** – responsibilities split across Architect, Gameplay, Graphics, UI, and QA.
- **Acceptance Tests** – gameplay behaviours or automated checks that must pass before moving forward.

Developers should read the active phase file prior to contributing and record updates inline when the scope evolves.
