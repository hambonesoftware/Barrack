# Phase 00 â€“ Planning

## Objectives
- Finalize the Barrack+ product vision with closed-off percentage win mechanics and procedural art requirements.
- Approve the Swift Playgrounds repository layout, including Agents documentation and shared data files.
- Confirm target platforms (iPad + Mac) and the SpriteKit/SwiftUI hybrid technology stack.

## Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Legacy scope creep**: maintain a shared glossary and push non-core ideas into a backlog.
- **Unclear data schemas**: spike `levels.json` and `palettes.json` early to validate structure.
- **Coordination gaps**: run asynchronous stand-ups captured in the Agents notes.

## Agent Responsibilities
- **Architect**: define module boundaries, build flags, and the base dependency graph between app, engine, gameplay, and render layers.
- **Gameplay Developer**: outline the beam growth algorithm, fill detection workflow, and deterministic RNG expectations.
- **Graphics Developer**: specify shader and particle concepts while confirming no external art imports.
- **UI Designer**: sketch menu and HUD wireframes plus accessibility toggles (palettes, reduced motion, dynamic type).
- **QA Engineer**: draft the acceptance checklist and categorize unit, integration, snapshot, and performance testing.

## Acceptance Tests
- Repository map mirrors the agreed phase plan and earns stakeholder sign-off.
- Example level data reviewed with confirmed `targetPercent` semantics.
- Deterministic RNG spike demonstrates the API for repeatable simulations.
